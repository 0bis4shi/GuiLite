GuiLite is written by 6000 lines C/C++ code, just like MFC/QT, it provide UI framework for developer.

GuiLite is a embeded UI framework, it can work with QT/MFC/UWP/Xcode APP, this mean you can not only develop your UI with Guilite, and also get QT/MFC/UWP/Android/Mac UI feature as well.

We hope you can develop some stable feature with GuiLite, then you can run your APP on Linux/Android/Windows/VR/MR/MCU at same time.
